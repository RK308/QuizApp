# Third Project - Quiz App

PROJECT SPECIFICATION

1. App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry. 

2. Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
   Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right        answer. 

3. App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score. 

4. The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout,    ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
   If applicable, the app uses nested ViewGroups to reduce the complexity of the layout.     

5. The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable        feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines. 

6. The code runs without errors. 

7. Each question has a correct answer.

8. Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once. 

9. The app contains at least one if/else statement.

10. The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.

11. The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include         incorrect answers in the count. 
    Note: When applicable, in the grading logic remember to check that the correct answers are checked AND the incorrect answers are not     checked.
